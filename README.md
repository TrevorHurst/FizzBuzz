# FizzBuzz
Shortest possible fizzbuzz code in Python, that is infinitely expandable!
Changing the F dictionary will change the behavior of the code, based on a classic programmers test

If divisible by 3 print "Fizz" 

If divisible by 5 print "Buzz" 

If neither print the number 

If both divisible 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz"

Your soulution should be expandable as best practice,interviewees will commonly ask you to add tests to your code i,e

If divisible by 10 print "Biff" and make sure the "FizzBuzzBiff" and "BuzzBiff" etc. rules all work

This is the shortest code I could come up with, if you can beat me go ahead and submit a pull request!
